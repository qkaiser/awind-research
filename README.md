# Awind Research

This repository holds interesting bits and pieces related to research I performed on wireless presentation devices manufactured by Awindinc and OEM'ed to multiple manufacturers.

The repository is split into these subsections:

* **hardware** - hardware hacking stuff, mostly for MMC dumping and pinout documentation
* **networking** - PIN code bruteforcer, custom Nmap scripts and fingerprints
* **exploits** - Metasploit modules and Python-based exploits.


## Affected devices

The following devices were OEM'ed by Awind and are therefore affected by the same issues.
